# Modelling the Geographic Distribution of Places of Birth of UK Members of Parliament over Time

This report causally models the geographical distribution of MPâ€™s place of birth, at a regional and historical county level, temporally from the first Parliament to present day. This analysis facilitates an evaluation of how geographically representative the MPs elected over time have been and highlights areas that are underrepresented or overrepresented.

Fair representation, as asserted by Philips [3], is achieved by there existing a loose correspondence between the experiences of those in government and their electorate [4]. This analysis provides an important dimension in answering how well the UK government has achieved fair representation. It finds specific relevance in understanding whether the historic regional funding bias [5] can be attributed to the geographic representativeness of MPs.
